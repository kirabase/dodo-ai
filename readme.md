HyperShell is designed to be compatible with a wide range of AI models, ensuring AI agnosticism. It seamlessly integrates with various ChatGPT models such as 3.5Turbo and GPT4. Additionally, it supports Claude from Anthropic, and it will continue to expand its compatibility as more models release their APIs to the public.

## Installation üì¶

1 - Clone the repository, change to the project directory, and install the required dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/kirabase/hyper-shell.git && \
cd hyper-shell && \
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: This installation guide assumes you're using macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). For Windows without WSL, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.

2 - Get your OpenAI API key:
_Note: The following procedure is specifically tailored for OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, as HyperShell is designed to support models from multiple vendors, you can follow a similar approach to enable Claude from Anthropic and other models as they release their APIs to the public._

HyperShell uses OpenAI to create its advanced behaviors, and it requires you to create an API key. To obtain an OpenAI API key, sign up for an account at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and navigate to the [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) section on your account page.

OpenAI API Costs and Free Usage: When you register an account, OpenAI provides a free tier with limited usage, requiring a credit card for verification. After exhausting the free tier, you'll need to choose a paid plan.
HyperShell uses GPT3.5, which will cost you a few cents a day. Monitor your API usage to avoid unexpected charges. For detailed pricing information, visit the [OpenAI Pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing).

3 - Set up your OpenAI API key:

If you want to try HyperShell just run it, the first time it will ask you for the key; if you don't want to do it at each session, HyperShell supports multiple ways to set the key:

_Option 1:_ Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your OpenAI API key:

Add the following line at the end of your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, or .bash_profile), replacing YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

After adding the line, restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc (or your shell config file), depending on the file you edited. The environment variable will now be available each time you open a new terminal session.

_Option 2:_ Create a config.ini file in the project directory, you can clone the teplate curated for you:

```
config_template.ini > config.ini
```

Open the config.ini file and search the line below; replace YOUR-OPENAI-KEY with your actual OpenAI API key:

```
[openai]
service_key = YOUR-OPENAI-KEY
```

This works under Linux and MacOS, adpat it if you use Windows or another OS.

4 - Create an alias for quick access

HyperShell becomes even more useful when it's easily accessible right when you need to generate or launch a command. To make it more convenient to run, create an alias.

To set up an alias, open your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, or .bash_profile) and add the following line at the end, replacing /path/to/dodo-ai/dodo.py with the actual path to the project directory:

```
alias dodo="python /path/to/hyper-shell/dodo.py"
```

After adding the alias, restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc (or the appropriate shell config file).
Now you can use the HyperShell command directly:

```
$ dodo "List the names of files containing the words 'Artificial Intelligence'"

grep -l "Artificial Intelligence" *
This command uses the grep command to search for the string "Artificial Intelligence" in all files in the current directory. The -l option tells grep to only print the names of the files containing the match.
```

## Usage üìñ

```
dodo "A verbal description of the command you'd like to run"
```

Replace your prompt with a natural language description of the task you want to perform.

### Command-line options

- -s, --short: Show only the generated command, without the explanation.
- -c, --coach: Show a very detailed explanation to learn and master your commands.
- -x, --execute: Execute the suggested command, the last one suggested if no prompt is provided.
- -r, --refine: Refine the command using a conversational flow.

## Examples üß≠

### Example 1: üê£ Working with simple commands

A simple use case is to write what you want to achive if you don't remember the command;
Here for example is a way to ask to list all the directory in the current location.

```
$ dodo "list all the directories"
ls -d */

Explanation:

This command lists all the directories in the current working directory.

The arguments used work this way:
- ls is the command to list directory contents.
- -d option is used to list only directories.
- */ is a pattern that matches all directories in the current directory. The * is a wildcard that matches any character - and the / specifies that only directories should be matched.
```

You can then refine the command with the continue mode,
just pretend to continue the conversation with the terminal.

```
$ dodo -c "only the hidden ones"
ls -d .*/
This command lists all the hidden directories in the current working directory. The arguments used work this way:

 ‚Ä¢ ls is the command to list directory contents.
 ‚Ä¢ d option is used to list only directories.
 ‚Ä¢ .*/ is a pattern that matches all hidden directories in the current directory. The dot
   (.) matches hidden files or directories, and the * is a wildcard that matches any
   character. The / specifies that only directories should be matched.
```

### Example 2: üê• More advanced examples

The AI service behind is really smart and is able to work with many different components,
here is an example where it uses variable and math to address your request.

```
$ dodo "generate a random number between 1 and 1000"
echo $((RANDOM % 1000 + 1))

Explanation:

- The $(( )) syntax is used for arithmetic expansion in bash.
- $RANDOM is a built-in bash variable that generates a random integer between 0 and 32767.
- We use the modulo operator % to limit the range of the random number between 0 and 999.
- We add 1 to the result to shift the range to 1-1000.
- Finally, echo is used to print the random number to the terminal.
```

### Example 3: üõ†Ô∏è Generate command for any popular tool

The knowledge of the tools expands outside the core bash commands,
and is able to generate complex commands from any popular command-line tool as well.

Here are a few examples:

```
$ dodo "git command to print the date of the last modification saved in the local repository"
git log -1 --format=%cd
This command will print the date of the last commit made in the local repository.

The arguments used work this way:

 ‚Ä¢ git log is a command that shows the commit logs.
 ‚Ä¢ -1 option tells git to show only the latest commit.
 ‚Ä¢ --format=%cd option specifies the format of the output to be the commit date. %cd is a
   placeholder that represents the commit date in a specified format.
```

```
$ python dodo.py "use npm to install the last version of React"
npm install react@latest
This command uses npm, the package manager for Node.js, to install the latest version of
React. The install command is used to install a package, and react@latest specifies that we
want to install the latest version of the React package.
```

## The Roadmap head üåà

We are committed to bringing monthly updates to HyperShell to explore the possibilities of AI-powered tools further. In our roadmap, we have several exciting features planned, including:

- **Support for Multiple LLMS**: We are working on expanding HyperShell's compatibility to include other popular Language Models like Bard and Cloude, offering you a wider range of options for generating commands.

- **Troubleshooting Mode**: We understand the frustration of encountering terminal errors and issues. That's why we are developing a dedicated troubleshooting mode to assist you in resolving problems faster and with more accuracy, providing step-by-step guidance.

- **Academy Mode**: We believe in continuous learning, and we're doubling down on it. The upcoming Academy mode will provide a comprehensive learning experience, with tutorials, exercises, and real-world examples to help you master the command-line and enhance your technical skills.

We're excited to evolve and improve HyperShell to meet your needs and make your command-line experience even more powerful and enjoyable.
