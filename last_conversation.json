Here's an example:\n\nCommand:\n```\ngit remote set-url origin <url>\ngit remote set-head origin -a <branch>\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `git remote set-url` sets the URL of the remote named `origin` to the specified `<url>`.\n- `git remote set-head` sets the default branch for the remote named `origin` to the specified `<branch>`. The `-a` option sets the default branch for all remotes.\n\nMake sure to replace `<url>` and `<branch>` with the appropriate values for your repository."}]
